#### Lynis Scan Investigation Log ####

## Purpose ##

This changelog will serve as a structured record of our investigation into CRYP-7902, documenting findings, actions taken, and final conclusions before moving forward with the vulnerability lab.

## Actions ##

CRYP-7902 Investigation & Resolution
Date: 03-14-2025
System: Ubuntu 22.04
Tools Used: Lynis, OpenSSL, Strace, Kernel Debugging

## Issue Summary ##

During a Lynis security audit, the CRYP-7902 test generated a long execution time warning:

[WARNING]: Test CRYP-7902 had a long execution: 36.24 seconds

This test checks cryptographic performance and kernel security settings.

## Steps and Findings ##

Step                                Actions                                 Findings
Checked Crypto Performance	        Ran OpenSSL speed test.	                Crypto performance is fast (1.6+ GB/s).
Verified Crypto Modules	            Listed active kernel modules.	        AES-NI is enabled; crypto acceleration is active.
Checked Kernel Entropy	            Checked system randomness.	            Entropy is sufficient; not a bottleneck.
Reviewed OpenSSL Policies	        Checked cipher settings.	            No weak ciphers found; OpenSSL is secure.
Checked Lynis Crypto Backend	    Verified if Lynis is using Libgcrypt.	Lynis defaults to Libgcrypt, which may be slower.
Forced OpenSSL in Lynis	            Set OpenSSL as crypto backend.	        No significant improvement in execution time.
Checked Kernel Security Features	Checked if ASLR is enabled.	A           SLR is on; minor impact on execution time.
Disabled ASLR & Retested	        Temporarily turned off ASLR.	        Slight improvement, but CRYP-7902 still runs slow.
Ran Lynis in Debug Mode	            Collected detailed logs.	            No major errors, just extended execution time.
Traced Lynis System Calls	        Used strace to analyze delays.	        Lynis is spending time verifying crypto settings.

## Conclusion ##

# No security vulnerability foundâ€”Lynis execution delay is due to test conditions, not an actual security risk.
# Crypto performance, kernel security, and encryption policies are all properly configured.
# Moving forward with vulnerability assessment.
